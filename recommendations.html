                                Imagine the greatest, brightest, smartest person you know. Will is that person to the millionth power. His dedication, patience, expertise, and willingness to put 110% of himself into everything he does is inspiring, and I know I speak for more than just myself when I say that. Watching him balance his challenging schoolwork, somehow ever-growing extracurriculars, and still managing to pick up the phone when friends or family rings is exceptional. I find myself in awe that one single person can carry that much potential, compassion, and humility. Whether in class or clubs, Will has never wavered away from being the responsible, driven, and more than capable individual he is. Within the first five seconds of meeting him, any team member knows they are in good company and that he is an incredible asset to have. To work with him is an immense privilege, and if you don't believe me, hire him and then get back to me. Brilliance has a name, and his name is William Jedrzejczak.

                                I connected with William Jedrzejczak on LinkedIn well before he landed his AWS Professional Services internship, and he immediately stood out. Most students send generic connection requests; William sent a thoughtful note asking how to combine customer obsession with hands‑on skills in AI and DevOps for the public sector. That focus on the right questions—rather than simply the "next" questions—told me he was operating several steps ahead of his peers. Once he joined AWS, we moved our conversations inside the firewall, and I watched him translate curiosity into impact at speed. He jumped onto high‑visibility internal projects, mapped out where he could add value, and then sought targeted guidance to close any gaps. He never asks for shortcuts, only for context that accelerates his own learning so he can serve customers better. That combination of initiative and humility is rare even among seasoned consultants. William's trajectory is going to the moon: whether as a future senior technologist, a standout consultant, or the founder of his own venture, he is going to make outsized contributions. I'm genuinely excited to see where he takes his career, and I consider it a privilege to play even a small part in that journey. Any team that gets him next will quickly realize they've hired a rising star.

                                Throughout my professional journey, from supporting over 1,800 secure missions under U.S. STRATCOM to advancing cybersecurity and compliance at NASA and now contributing to secure, cloud-focused delivery at AWS, I've worked alongside individuals at every level. William Jedrzejczak is, without question, one of the most promising young professionals I've come across. He brings a level of focus, humility, and discipline that you don't see often, especially not from someone still completing their undergraduate degree. He doesn't just execute. He engages. He listens, absorbs, and applies feedback with intention. He asks the right questions, takes initiative, and holds himself to a high standard. But beyond the skills and potential, it's his consistency and character that set him apart. William is one of the most grounded and driven young men I've had the chance to work with. Watching him grow, contribute, and stay locked in has been a privilege. He's not chasing titles. He's doing the work. And the industry doesn't just need more people like him. It needs to make room for them.
